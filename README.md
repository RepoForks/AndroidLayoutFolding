Gradle plugin for Android that allows a project to define folders inside the layout directory. Basically
it uses the normal merging mechanism that the android plugin uses by itself, declaring 
the folders recursively as resources directory.

Take the following structure as an example:
```
src/main/res/layout/
    myLayout.xml
    activities/layout/
        activity1.xml
        activity2.xml
src/debug/res/layout/
    activities/layout/
        activity1.xml
```

As you may notice it also supports different build variants, flavours and dimensions.

# Instructions
Add the plugin to the classpath of your root build.gradle:
```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.droidpl:lfolding:1.0'
    }
}
```

Apply this plugin to the build.gradle your project:
```groovy
apply plugin: "lfolding"
```

This will enable the behaviour automatically.
